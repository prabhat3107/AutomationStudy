# Ansible: Up and Running (3rd edition) code samples

This repository contains code samples from [Ansible: Up and
Running, 3rd. Ed.  ISBN:978-1-098-10915-8](http://ansiblebook.com), organized by book chapter.

The book is published by O'Reilly https://oreil.ly/lOxWu

Note that most chapters have a single subdirectory named *playbooks*. I did this
so that the directory structure of the code would match the directory structure
in the book, since the book always assumes a playbooks directory.

If you encounter any problems with these samples, please submit a GitHub issue
or a pull request against this repository.

Readers of the [Early Release on the O'Reilly site](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ansible-up-and/9781098109141/) should checkout the branch 3rd-edition.
