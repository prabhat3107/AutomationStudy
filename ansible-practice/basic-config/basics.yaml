#comment in YAML start with a # and apply till end of the line as like python, bash etc. 
# Like python, YAML uses space indentation to reduce number of interpucutation characters. 
# as a starndard two spaces are used as in pythohn. 
# white space is used between each task in a playbook, and between sections in files.

# Ansible stings need not be between quoats even if there are spaces in between. 
# in some scenarios we need to quoate them. 
# Double-quoting typically involves use of variable interpolations or other expressions. 
# single-quoting users for lieral values that should not be evaluated. 
# Boolean vlues must not be put in quoataion. 

# Valid Booleans in YAML

# true, True, TRUE, yes, Yes, YES, on, On, ON
#false, Flse, FALSE, no, No, NO, off, Off, OFF
